This is a placeholder for image.png for Sample Game 1 (Void Runner - Protocol C).

Please replace this file with an actual PNG image. This image could be used for:
- A player sprite if the game used sprite-based graphics.
- An obstacle image.
- A background element.
- UI icons within the game.

For example, if you create a 32x32 pixel art ship for the player, you would save it as 'image.png' in this 'assets' directory.
The game's JavaScript ('main.js') would then need to be updated to load and use this image.

Currently, 'main.js' for Void Runner uses procedurally drawn shapes on the canvas and does not load external images.
If you wish to use this image, you would modify the drawing functions in 'main.js'
(e.g., `drawPlayer()` or `drawObstacles()`) to use `ctx.drawImage()` with this asset after loading it with `new Image()` and setting its `src`.
