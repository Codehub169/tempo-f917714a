/*
  This is a placeholder for the game_thumb_default.png image file.

  This image is intended to be used as a default thumbnail for games in the Cyberpunk Arcade Dashboard when a specific thumbnail is not available.
  It is referenced in `backend/initial_games.json` for some game entries.

  To use a default game thumbnail:
  1. Create or find a suitable generic game thumbnail image that fits the cyberpunk aesthetic.
     - Dimensions like 200x150 pixels or 300x200 pixels are common for thumbnails, but choose what best fits your design.
     - It could be a simple logo, an abstract design, or a silhouette that represents a generic game.
  2. Name the image file `game_thumb_default.png`.
  3. Ensure it's a PNG file (or update references if you use another format like JPG).
  4. Place the image file in this directory: `frontend/public/assets/images/`.

  Replace this placeholder comment with the actual image file.
