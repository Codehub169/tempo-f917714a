     - Ensure the image is royalty-free or you have the necessary rights to use it.
  2. Name the image file `cyberpunk_bg.jpg` (or update references in the CSS if you use a different name).
  3. Place the image file in this directory: `frontend/public/assets/images/`.

     body {
       background-image: url('/assets/images/cyberpunk_bg.jpg');

       background-repeat: no-repeat;
